# Case Study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?
In this case study we will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. For the director of marketing of the company’s, future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, the director of marketing believes there is a
very good chance to convert casual riders into members.

In order to help the company design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members, some questions need to be answered

* 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
* 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
* 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

This case study will focus on the first question.

## How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

### 1. A clear statement of the business task
The objective is to analyze and compare the usage habits of annual members and casual riders of Cyclistic bicycles in order to identify differences in their behavior and preferences. The goal is to gain insights that can be used to design effective marketing strategies to convert casual cyclists into annual members. By understanding the key factors that influence user behavior and preferences, Cyclistic can tailor its marketing efforts to better meet the needs of casual cyclists and encourage them to become long-term loyal customers.


### 2. A description of all data sources used
The data used in this study are Cyclistic’s historical trip data. The initial case study suggests to get only the previous 12 months trips data but we will consider all data (from January 2015 to March 2023). This could give more insights regarding changes over years.

There are several csv files containing trips data ([seen list sata sets here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)). The name of variables are not consistent across all data sets but they contain similar information. The information that can be found in these data sets are:

* trip_id: ID attached to each trip taken
* start_time: day and time trip started, in CST
* stop_time: day and time trip ended, in CST
* bikeid: ID attached to each bike
* tripduration: time of trip in seconds 
* from_station_name: name of station where trip originated
* to_station_name: name of station where trip terminated 
* from_station_id: ID of station where trip originated
* to_station_id: ID of station where trip terminated
* usertype: "Customer" is a rider who purchased a 24-Hour Pass; "Subscriber" is a rider who purchased an Annual Membership
* gender: gender of rider 

This project contains different files with different purpose:

* [first_step__extraction_script](https://github.com/bationoA/How_does_a_bike_share_navigate_speedy_success/blob/main/first_step__extraction_script.Rmd): Contains scripts to download all data sets, extract and combine relevant csv files. The extractions scripts can easily be modify to download only data sets based on years. The scripts in this file should be the first to be ran
* [second_step__Formating](https://github.com/bationoA/How_does_a_bike_share_navigate_speedy_success/blob/main/second_step__Formating.Rmd): To be ran at the after first_step__extraction_script, it contains scripts to consolidate the format of data sets (date-time), rename columns or combine all data sets into only 2
* [third_step__Cleaning](https://github.com/bationoA/How_does_a_bike_share_navigate_speedy_success/blob/main/third_step__Cleaning.Rmd): This contains scripts for cleaning the previous 2 data sets and combine them into one. 
* [fourth_step__analysis](https://github.com/bationoA/How_does_a_bike_share_navigate_speedy_success/blob/main/fourth_step__analysis.Rmd): This file contains scripts for all the analysis related to to case study


### 4. A summary of your analysis
### In general

Comment: After removing the outliers it appears that 'member' subscription type of customers tend to use the bikes for shorter trips compared to the 'casual' customers. Let's assess the strength of this hypothesis throught a statistical test.

```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Caption for the figure", out.width = "100%", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("outputs", "img", "box_plots__ride_duration_by_customer_type.png"))
```

### Annual
Overall, the number of bike rides each year is decreasing. However, it is worth noting that consumers with yearly subscriptions ('members') regularly take more bike journeys than casual customers over the course of the study.

From 2015 to March 2023, the average trip duration for 'member' customers does not show significant variation compared to 'casual' customers. However, 'casual' customers consistently use the bikes for much longer trips than 'member' customers, with trip duration ranging from 53% to 73% longer.

From 2015 to March 2023, the duration of bike trips taken by casual customers was consistently 53% to 73% longer than those taken by customers with an annual subscription. This finding suggests that casual customers may use the bikes for leisure or recreational purposes, while members may use them for more utilitarian purposes such as commuting. It also raises questions about the pricing structure and value proposition for casual customers, who may be paying more per trip compared to members but may not be utilizing the service as frequently. Further analysis of customer behavior and preferences could provide insights into potential strategies for increasing casual customer engagement and loyalty.

```{r fig2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(file.path("outputs", "img", "line_plots__average_number_of_rides_and_duration_per_customer_by_year.png")))
```

### Monthly

Comment: The number of bike rides for each type of customer appears to be normally distributed over the months. However, there is a clear trend that annual subscribers ('member') have been taking more bike trips per month compared to casual customers since 2015.

Comment: Based on the data, it appears that there is a significant difference in the average trip duration between casual customers and annual subscribers ('member') on a monthly basis. Despite a slight decrease in the average duration over time, casual customers consistently take longer bike trips compared to annual subscribers.

Comment: The average time spent for monthly trips by casual customers is more than the double of the average time spent by member customers.

```{r fig3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(file.path("outputs", "img", "bar_plots__average_number_of_rides_and_duration_per_customer_by_month.png")))
```

### Daily

Comment: Casual and member customers tend to use bikes at the same rate during weekends (Saturday and Sunday). However, during working days, member customers use the bikes 1 to 2 times more frequently than casual customer.

Comment: From 2015 to March 2023, casual customers have been using the bikes for longer than member customers

Comment: The average time spent for daily trips by casual customers is more than the double of the average time spent by member customers.

```{r fig4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(file.path("outputs", "img", "bar_plots__average_number_of_rides_and_duration_per_customer_by_day.png")))
```

### T-Test for comparing the distribution of the duraction trip of the two types of customes (casual and member)

1. T-Test test
The assumptions of the two-sample Student test (T-Test) are:

    Normality: The data should be approximately normally distributed within each group.
    Independence: The observations within each group should be independent.
    Homogeneity of variance: The variance of the data should be equal in both groups.
    Random sampling: The samples should be randomly selected from their respective populations.
    
    
a. Homogeneity of variance test test
alpha = 0.05
p-value  < 2.2e-16
Comment: We reject the null hypothesis (H0, with more than 99.99% confidence) of the homogeneity of variance of the duration of rides between the 'casual' and 'member' customers.

b. Homogeneity of variance test
alpha = 0.05
p-value  < 2.2e-16
Comment: For both 'casual' and 'member', the values of rides duration are not normally distributed ((H0, with more than 99.99% confidence))
Many assumptions of a T-Test are violated. If we still decide to proceed with the The T-test, these violations should be mentioned.

c. Student test (T-Test)
Let's conduct a T-Test despite the violation of some of its assumptions.
alpha = 0.05
p-value  < 2.2e-16
Comment: We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in the average duration of the trips between 'casual' and 'member' customers is  statistically significant. However, it should be noted that the assumptions for the T-Test was violated.

2. Non parametric test: Wilcoxon, equality of medians
alpha = 0.05
p-value  < 2.2e-16
Comment: We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in the duration of the trips between 'casual' and 'member' customers is  statistically significant.

Once upon a time, a bike-sharing company wanted to know if there was a significant difference in the duration of the trips between two categories of customers: 'casual' and 'member'. To answer this question, the company decided to conduct a statistical analysis.

First, they ran a homogeneity of variance test to check if the variances of the data were equal in both groups. The result was not in their favor, and they had to reject the null hypothesis with more than 99.99% confidence. Next, they ran a normality test, which showed that the duration of the rides for both categories was not normally distributed. These violations of assumptions were taken into account before proceeding with the T-Test.

Despite the violated assumptions, the company decided to conduct a T-Test, which resulted in rejecting the null hypothesis with more than 99.99% confidence. This meant that there was a statistically significant difference in the average duration of trips between the two categories of customers. However, it was crucial to note that the assumptions for the T-Test were violated.

Finally, the company conducted a non-parametric test called Wilcoxon, which tests the equality of medians. The result was also not in their favor, and they had to reject the null hypothesis with more than 99.99% confidence. Thus, they concluded that the difference in the duration of trips between 'casual' and 'member' customers was statistically significant, regardless of the type of test used.

In conclusion, the company found a significant difference in the duration of trips between the two categories of customers, but they had to be mindful of the violated assumptions. This shows the importance of understanding and fulfilling the assumptions of a test before interpreting its results.

### 5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
### 6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis


Knowing that:
1. There are more rides initiated by member customers than casual customers during working days (Monday to Friday)
2. casual and member customers have similar number of rides during weekends (Saturday, Sunday)
3. Everyday, the average trip duration initiated by casual customers last longer than the ones initiated

The goal is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
These analysis answer to the question "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"

Wile taking into account the results of the previous statistical tests, Give 5 recommendations based on your analysis


Based on the results of the statistical tests and the information provided, here are five recommendations for designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members:

Offer incentives for customers who use the service during weekdays: Since annual members ride more often during the weekdays, the company can offer incentives to casual riders who ride on weekdays, such as discounts or promotional codes. This can help to increase the number of weekday rides among casual riders and, in turn, convert them into annual members.

Promote shorter trips: Since casual customers tend to have longer trip durations compared to annual members, the company can create promotions or special packages for shorter trips that would appeal to casual riders. This can help to convert casual riders into annual members who tend to take more frequent but shorter trips.

Target infrequent casual riders: The company can target casual riders who ride less frequently but still use the service, especially during weekends. These riders may be more likely to convert to annual members if they are given incentives or promotions to use the service more often, especially during weekdays.

Offer membership trial periods: The company can offer casual riders the chance to try out the annual membership for a certain period of time (e.g. a week or a month) to see if they would benefit from the service. This can help to increase the number of annual members by giving casual riders a chance to experience the benefits of an annual membership without committing to it fully.

Create a community for annual members: Since annual members tend to be more frequent users of the service, the company can create a community for them to promote social interaction and encourage them to use the service more often. This can help to increase their loyalty to the service and encourage casual riders to convert to annual members.
