## Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

* 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
* 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
* 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

By understanding the key factors that influence user behavior and preferences, Cyclistic can tailor its marketing efforts to better meet the needs of casual cyclists and encourage them to become long-term loyal customers.
