```
Note: 'ride_length' expresses the duration of a ride in seconds. This is a 
fictional data and at least one ride has a duration of 1 second which is too 
short duration in a real life scenario. 

Let's remove all ride with a 'ride_length' less than 5 minutes and convert it 
to minutes

```{r}
df <- filter(df, ride_length >= 5*60) %>% 
  mutate(ride_length = round(ride_length / 60)) 
print("Done.")
```

```

Comment: Our dataset's descriptive statistics for 'ride_length' revealed a few interesting findings. The most brief trip lasted 5 minutes, while the longest ride lasted an incredible 238,940 minutes, which is almost 166 days! The average length of all rides was discovered to be 23.55 minutes. The median ride duration of 14 minutes, on the other hand, is a better representation of a typical ride length since it is closer to the majority of the values than the mean. The first quartile of ride lengths was 9 minutes, suggesting that 25% of the rides were completed in that amount of time. The third quartile stood at 23 minutes, which means that 75% of the trips were that long or less.

In summary, these statistics indicate that our dataset has a wide variety of ride lengths, with some being quite short and others being exceedingly long, with most rides lasting between 9 and 23 minutes. These information might help uncover trends and patterns in ride length, which could help drive decision-making in areas like route design and pricing strategies.

Comment: The descriptive statistics for ride lengths in our dataset are presented in the table above, broken down by membership type: casual and member. The average ride time for casual riders was 40.03 minutes, which is more than double the average ride length for members, which was 15.35 minutes. However, it's worth noting that the average ride time for casual riders was just 21 minutes, while it was 11 minutes for members. This implies that, while the dataset contains some very lengthy casual rides, the vast majority of trips are far shorter. 
The longest ride length for casual bikers was 238,940 minutes, which is more than 165 days! The longest ride length for members was 225,960 minutes, which is also a very long time. The minimum riding time for both groups was 5 minutes, indicating that some rides may have been cut short for various reasons. Overall, these statistics indicate that our dataset has a wide variety of ride lengths, with some being quite short and others being exceedingly long. These information might help uncover trends and patterns in ride length, which could help drive decision-making in areas like route design and pricing strategies.

Comment: After removing the outliers it appears that 'member' subscription type of customers tend to use the bikes for shorter trips compared to the 'casual' customers. Let's assess the strength of this hypothesis through a statistical test.

## T-Test for comparing the average duraction trip of the to types of customes (casual and member)
The assumptions of the two-sample t-test are:

    Normality: The data should be approximately normally distributed within each group.
    Independence: The observations within each group should be independent.
    Homogeneity of variance: The variance of the data should be equal in both groups.
    Random sampling: The samples should be randomly selected from their respective populations.

Result: p-value < 2.2e-16 < alpha = 0.05 for both 'casual' and 'member'
Comment: For both 'casual' and 'member', the values of rides duration are not normally distributed
Many assumptions of a T-Test are violated. If we still decide to proceed with the The T-test, these violations should be mentioned.

Running the T-Test anyway
```{r}
# For this test we choose alpha = 0.05
# H0: averages trips duration for 'casual' and 'member' customers are not statistically different

```
Result: p-value < 2.2e-16 < alpha = 0.05
Comment: We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in the average duration of the trips between 'casual' and 'member' customers is  statistically significant. However, it should be noted that the assumptions for the T-Test was violated.

Comment: The number of bike rides for each type of customer appears to be normally distributed over the months. However, there is a clear trend that annual subscribers ('member') have been taking more bike trips per month compared to casual customers since 2015.

Comment: Based on the data, it appears that there is a significant difference in the average trip duration between casual customers and annual subscribers ('member') on a monthly basis. Despite a slight decrease in the average duration over time, casual customers consistently take longer bike trips compared to annual subscribers.

  group_by(member_casual, month) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n(),

  pivot_wider(id_cols = month, names_from = member_casual, values_from = average_duration) %>% 
  mutate(average_duration_casual_relative_member = (casual - member) / member)
```
Comment: The average time spent for monthly trips by casual customers is more than the double of the average time spent by member customers.

Comment: Overall, the number of bike rides each year is decreasing. However, it is worth noting that consumers with yearly subscriptions ('members') regularly take more bike journeys than casual customers over the course of the study.

Comment: From 2015 to March 2023, the average trip duration for 'member' customers does not show significant variation compared to 'casual' customers. However, 'casual' customers consistently use the bikes for much longer trips than 'member' customers, with trip duration ranging from 53% to 73% longer.

From 2015 to March 2023, the duration of bike trips taken by casual customers was consistently 53% to 73% longer than those taken by customers with an annual subscription. This finding suggests that casual customers may use the bikes for leisure or recreational purposes, while members may use them for more utilitarian purposes such as commuting. It also raises questions about the pricing structure and value proposition for casual customers, who may be paying more per trip compared to members but may not be utilizing the service as frequently. Further analysis of customer behavior and preferences could provide insights into potential strategies for increasing casual customer engagement and loyalty.

Comment: There is a clear difference between casual and member customers in terms of starting station. The Streeter Dr & Grand Ave station accounts for 1.55% (457,718) of rides initiated by casual customers, which is more than 2 times the number of started rides by member customers (124,443 trips). In the other hand, 0.94% (278,769) of rides initiated by member customers are from the Clinton St & Washington Blvd station. However their number of rides  less differ from the one of casual customers as it is just 0.92 times higher than the number of rides of casual customers.

Comment: The most frequently used bikes among all customers are classic bikes, accounting for approximately 44.59% of all trips. Since 2020, customers with annual subscriptions have been using classic bikes more frequently, making up 60.78% of all trips. The use of docked bikes is quite similar for both customer types, with casual riders accounting for 50.46% of trips made with these bikes.

One finding is that there is a difference in the preferred bike type between casual riders and customers with annual subscription. Casual riders tend to use docked bikes more frequently than electric bikes, while customers with annual subscription tend to use electric bikes more frequently than docked bikes even if both tend to use classic bikes much more often than the others type of bikes.

More analysis is needed in order to determine if is really a matter of preference of availability.

In terms of trip duration, no matter which type of bike is considered, casual customers tend to use them much longer during each ride than customers with annual subscriptions. Indeed, casual riders use docked bikes at least two times longer than member customers (67 versus 18 minutes) , while classic and electric bikes have average trip duration of 31 and 20 minutes, respectively.

Electric bikes are used for shorter trips by both casual and member customers, which could be attributed to the battery life, even though most electric bikes can still be used as classic bikes with low battery power. Further analysis could be done to investigate the reason behind this difference in duration among bike types.

```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(member_casual, month) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n(),
            average_duration = mean(ride_length)
            ) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, month) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = month, names_from = member_casual, values_from = average_duration) %>% 
  mutate(average_duration_casual_relative_member = (casual - member) / member)
```
Comment: The average time spent for monthly trips by casual customers is more than the double of the average time spent by member customers.
